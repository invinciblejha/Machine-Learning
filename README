Here are some things that I'm working for my learning machine class.
Feel free to use, modify, or do whatever you want with this code.

Please, if you do something new, send me a pull request or a patch.

If you wanna colaborate, there are some #TODO in the code and
you can add other algorhitms too.

Some of the functions weren't tested, so, you can do that too.

tks,
Dayvid Victor
