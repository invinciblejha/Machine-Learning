Here are some things that I'm working for my learning machine class.
Feel free to use, modify, or do whatever you want with this code.

Please, if you do something new, send me a pull request or a patch to me.

If you wanna colaborate, there are some #TODO in the code and you can add
other algorhitms too, nothing is too little, you can commit anything related
to machine learning and AI.

Some of the functions weren't tested, so, you can do that too.

tks,
Dayvid Victor
